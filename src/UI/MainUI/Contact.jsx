        <section>I am a software developer with four years of commercial
                experience focused on JavaScript, TypeScript, and React.
                I have been working for Carfax US for the last few years where I actively contributed to a broad
                spectrum of projects.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                During this time, we managed to develop existing solutions and create new products
                that brought real income. In addition, I also dealt with more internal needs, such as adapting
                Accessibility to WCAG requirements or developing the company's system design.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Currently, I am a freelancer, have my first clients and I am doing my work to provide products of
                the highest quality and, above all, in accordance with the requirements. In addition,
                I teach the basics of web development and help people enter the IT industry.
